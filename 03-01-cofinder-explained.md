title: CoFinder data infrastructure
---

CoFinder is a system designed to automate the process of identifying relevant job ads for different Knowit organisations and matching them with the most suitable consultants. The fundamental idea is to gather job advertisements from various external sources, such as Verama, Fieldglass, and HubSpot, and integrate this information with our consultants' professional profiles and experiences retrieved from Cinode. By connecting opportunities with internal talent, CoFinder aims to streamline business development, allowing the company to quickly identify which relevant job ads have been posted and which specific consultants are well-suited for them.

At the heart of CoFinder is a data pipeline orchestrated using Dagster. The first main step involves ingesting, cleansing, and consolidating all job advertisements into a unified data store. These jobs are then subjected to an evaluation process where they are ranked for relevance to the company. Simultaneously, consultant data from Cinode which represent individual skills and experiences is processed and run through an embedding model. The final step involves matching the relevant job ads against the consultant profiles, generating a rank for each consultant/job pairing. The resulting matches and detailed data are loaded into a database and made available for review and action via the CoFinder Portal. See *Figure 1* for a schematic of the data flow in the main pipeline.

Below, each stage is explained in more detail.

## Job ad data ingestion

The job ad ingestion process begins by fetching advertisements from various external sources, including Verama and Fieldglass. This data is extracted using DLT assets for some sources and Python assets for others, and then cleansed and transformed using DBT. The data are further enriched e.g. by adding geographic locations to each ad before all input is consolidated into a unified intermediate table *int_union_job_ads*. This unified table then flows into the next step: match evaluation by the Large Language Model (LLM).

## Job ad matching 

The LLM evaluation process takes the consolidated job ads and determines their relevance to each onboarded Knowit organisation separately using the prompts stored in *stg_company*. his function is handled by an asset that queries an LLM, with the company prompt (containing a description of what types of advertisements the company is interested in) as "system instructions" and the job ad as the "user input". The LLM assigns a rank (a score between 0-10) and provides a motivation or explanation for that rank, adding these details as columns to the resulting *int_evaluated_job_ads* table. The LLM call stacks are tracked using **Phoenix**.

## Consultant data ingestion

The consultant skills and experiences are imported from their Cinode profile and saved in *int_people_experience*. The pipeline only draws from the data in the profile section, not from targeted CVs. 

## Embeddings

The tables *int_evaluated_job_ads* and *int_people_experience* are converted into embedding space and saved to **LanceDB**. For consultant experience, if English language version exists, this is used for embeddings. If not, then Swedish, then other languages. For job ads, the language of the job ad is used. 
The embedding model used is **mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1**.

**Improvement suggestion**: The used embedding model is English-only. To improve embeddings and increase the quality of matches in the RAG step, translating all content to English first or using a multi-language embedding model would be preferable.

## RAG + consultant matching

For all ads that received a rank above 0 in the job ad evaluation step, each consultant for the company in question is run through RAG +consultant matching. In the retrieval step the top **200?????** experience embeddings that are the most similar to the job ad embedding are retrieved, and the corresponding consultants are selected for evaluation. 

In consultant matching, an LLM call is made with the job ad, consultant skills and the prompt found in *datadrivet-infra-opendatastack/processing/prompts/knowit_consultant_matcher_msg.txt*. Each evaluated consultant receives a rank from 1 to 10 indicating their suitability for the assignment, together with a motivation to the rank.

## Output

The output from consultant matching step is saved in *obt_consultant_matches*. This table is then used as a source for sending notifications to channels like Slack and Teams, and is synced to a table called "matchingconsultants" in a **Postgres** database used for displaying the data in the CoFinder portal.
