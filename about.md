# About Datadrivet Infrastructure

## Our Philosophy

The Datadrivet infrastructure is designed around the principle of **reproducible development environments**. We believe that every developer should be able to clone a repository and have a fully functional development environment within minutes, without manual setup or configuration.

## Technology Stack

### Core Tools

- **Nix** - A powerful package manager that ensures reproducible builds and deployments
- **Devenv** - A developer-friendly wrapper around Nix that simplifies environment management
- **Direnv** - Automatically loads environment variables and activates development environments

### Why This Stack?

1. **Reproducibility** - Every developer gets exactly the same environment
2. **Isolation** - Each project has its own dependencies without conflicts
3. **Cross-platform** - Works consistently across Linux, macOS, and Windows (WSL)
4. **Version pinning** - Lock specific versions of tools and dependencies
5. **Instant activation** - Environment loads automatically when entering a project directory

## Security Model

Our infrastructure uses **SOPS (Secrets OPerationS)** for secure secret management:

- Secrets are encrypted at rest in Git repositories
- Each developer has their own age key for decryption
- Fine-grained access control per project
- No secrets in plaintext ever committed to version control
