## Overview

Our infrastructure is built on the foundation of Nix + Devenv + Direnv to
provide:

- **Reproducible environments** - Eliminate "works on my machine" issues
- **Isolated dependencies** - Each project has its own environment
- **Automatic setup** - Environment activates when you enter a project directory
- **Cross-platform support** - Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (WSL)

Get started by following our [Getting Started](02-getting-started.html) guide.
